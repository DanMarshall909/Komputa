# Komputa Project Vision

## Core Concept
Komputa is envisioned as a **memory-aware voice assistant** that responds to the wake phrase "hey komputa" and provides intelligent, personalized conversational interactions through speech. Enhanced with dRAGster's cognitive memory system, Komputa learns, remembers, and adapts to user interactions over time.

## Key Features & User Experience

### Voice Activation
- **Wake Word Detection**: System continuously listens for "hey komputa" trigger phrase
- **Hands-free Operation**: Users can interact without touching keyboard/mouse
- **Natural Speech Recognition**: Processes natural language voice commands

### Memory-Enhanced AI Intelligence
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages GPT models for intelligent response generation
- **Cognitive Memory System**: Powered by dRAGster for human-like memory management
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation context across sessions and time
- **Learning Capability**: Remembers user preferences, patterns, and personal information
- **Dynamic Processing**: Real-time query processing with memory-informed responses

### Audio Feedback
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI responses to natural-sounding speech
- **Audio Quality**: Clear, human-like voice output for seamless interaction
- **Responsive Feedback**: Immediate audio confirmation and responses

### Personalized Memory Features
- **Conversation Continuity**: Remembers previous discussions and can reference them
- **User Preferences**: Learns and adapts to individual communication styles
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands personal context and situations
- **Smart Forgetting**: Uses time-based decay to naturally forget less important information
- **Privacy Controls**: User commands to manage what is remembered or forgotten

## Target User Experience
1. User says "hey komputa" 
2. System activates and provides audio confirmation (beep/acknowledgment)
3. User speaks their question or command
4. System processes through OpenAI API
5. System responds with spoken answer
6. System returns to listening state

## Design Philosophy
- **Conversational**: Natural, human-like interaction patterns
- **Responsive**: Fast processing and minimal latency
- **Accessible**: Voice-first interface for hands-free computing
- **Intelligent**: Powered by cutting-edge AI language models

## Success Metrics
- Voice recognition accuracy
- Response relevance and quality
- System response time
- User engagement and satisfaction
